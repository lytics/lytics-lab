# Code style

We enforce strict code style guidelines, but we have tooling to support it, so developers shouldn't need to think about code style much. Our goal is to make it so code style is something that never needs to be discussed. Whatever the tool spits out, that's our code style ðŸ¤“!

We use two main tools to assist with the autoformatting that should be installed locally:
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
